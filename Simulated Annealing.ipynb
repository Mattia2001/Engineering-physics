    "# Simulated annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "The annealing is a metallurgical process in which the temperature of a metal is increased and then gradually decreased. In this way, the molecules of the material are first brought into a highly disordered state and then they move to a more ordered disposition i.e. the crystal lattice. The cooling must occur sufficently slowly but then the material will result hardened by the process. A similar approach can be used to solve optimization processes which require to find the minimum (or the maximum) of a multi-dimentionate function, in presence of multiple local minima (or maxima), which make it impossible to use exact methods such as gradient descent. In opposition to Metropolis-Hastings method, which always samples configurations with lower energy than the current one, the simulated annealing can select configurations whose energy is higher than the current one with a certain probability. This probability is very high in the first stages of the algorithm, when the temperature is high, then, as the cooling moves takes place,  it will be more and more unlikely to select energetically-disadvantageous configurations. This part of the algorithm is fundamental because it allows us to avoid local minima or maxima, which act as traps for any exact algorithm. The cooling must occur slowly enough to allow the algorithm to reach the global minimum of the function. \n",

    "A common example of usage of this algorithm is to solve the problem of the travelling salesman. By the way, it finds its main applications in computational chemistry, digital electronics, jobs placement and, in general, in all those contexts where the research space is discrete."

    "Here we propose a function for low-temperature annealing, which can be invoked to optimize a sub-optimal result obtained by a high-temperature simulated annealing. The function receives as input the sub-optimal route as well as the exponent of the initial and final temperatures. Then, the sub-optimal route is processed via simualted annealing with the given data. If the length of the resulting route is smaller, then restart the annealing by decreasing by 1 the exponent of the initial temperature. This is needed to keep optimizing the route without disrupting the ordered structure obtained in previous annealing schedules. If the length is intstead longer then the previous one, then it is admissible to increase by 1 the exponent, in order to move away fro mthe local minimum. We keep doing so until the exponent of the initial temperature is equal to - 2 (I played with the algorithm many times and I found that there are no more swaps once the temperateure reached $10^{-2}$ but I remain open to more rigorous formulations)."
